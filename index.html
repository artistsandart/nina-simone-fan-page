    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p>
    Nina Simone is a modern-day musical genius. Born on February 21, 1933, she began playing piano at the age of three. As a child, she also sang in her church choir. Simone's training was focused in classical music, landing her admittance into Julliard School. However, she did not come from extravagant means, and took up teaching to support her education. Her childhood instructor also helped with financing her academics, but the funds still ran out. After the setback, she moved in with family in hopes of gaining more affordable education. However, she was rejected from Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.
    <br><br/>
    Although this event must have been extremely painful, Nina Simone started experimenting with different genres. Perhaps it was in response to the discrimination she had just experienced, perhaps not, but the life she encountered after led to the exploration of American standards, jazz and blues. She also began performing in Atlantic City clubs, and in her autobiography, she mentions the owner's insistence on her singing along with her piano accompaniment. In the 1950's, Simone began recording her music, making her work available for everyone to enjoy.
    <br><br/>
    In the 1960's, Nina Simone became known as a voice for the Civil Rights Movement. Then in the 1970's, she had to take a break for personal reasons. Yet, this was not the end of the legend's career. By the end of the decade, she returned to recording and by the 1980's she partook in a career renaissance. Nina Simone maintained a steady fan base until her death in 2003. Arguably, after her passing, Simone's iconic stature grew even stronger. To this day, documentaries continue to capture the beauty of her gift, movies feature her songs, her home has become a national treasure, and her music touches generations to come.
